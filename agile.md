**What is Agile?**

**Agile** is a methodological approach to software development that prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, and responsiveness to change. It emerged as an alternative to traditional development methods that tended to be rigid and poorly adaptable to fluctuations in client and market requirements. Instead of meticulously planning the entire project from the outset, Agile promotes the incremental and continuous delivery of value through short and frequent iterations known as sprints or development cycles. This approach allows teams to quickly adapt to new opportunities or changes in requirements, as constant feedback from clients is crucial for adjusting and improving the product in each iteration.

One of the fundamental principles of Agile is close and constant collaboration among different team members and stakeholders. Agile teams are often multidisciplinary and self-organized, fostering direct communication and joint decision-making. Furthermore, Agile promotes transparency and visibility of project progress through practices such as regular demonstration of completed work and continuous prioritization of the backlog. This transparency not only helps keep everyone informed about the project's status but also facilitates early identification of issues and implementation of necessary adjustments. In summary, Agile is not just about adopting a set of practices and tools but also about cultivating a culture of adaptability, collaboration, and continuous improvement throughout the organization or development team.

To implement Agile, there are several widely recognized frameworks, such as Scrum, Kanban, and Lean XP, each with its own characteristics and specific applications within agile software development.
